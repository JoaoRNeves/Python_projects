# 🐍 Python Projects

This repository is where I keep track of my Python learning journey — a mix of side projects, tools I’ve developed to support my research, and random bits of code that helped me solve small problems along the way. Most of the content here was developed independently, with some occasional help from AI (especially when building GUIs or fixing annoying bugs I couldn’t untangle on my own).

You’ll probably find (now or in the future):
- Beginner-level scripts that helped me understand Python basics  
- Utility tools for text parsing, data cleaning, and simple file automation  
- GUI experiments for personal use or lab tasks  
- Lots of comments, some messy logic, and notes-to-self  

> This is not meant to be a polished portfolio — it's more of a digital notebook.  
> I'm sharing it publicly because:
> - It helps me track what I’ve done and how I think  
> - Maybe others can learn from the mistakes I’ve made  
> - I believe in open, transparent learning

## 🧠 Why Coding?

I am startin to learn how to code because I realized how much it could help me in my day-to-day research work. From processing large sets of microscopy or MRI images, to cleaning data or building small automation tools — coding can make things faster, more reproducible, and less frustrating overall.

It also feels like an essential skill to have in today’s research and job market. Knowing how to code, mainly python, opens doors to fields like data science, image analysis, and machine learning — all of which are increasingly connected to biology and neuroscience. So even if I’m still figuring it all out, I know it’s worth the effort.

Plus, there’s something really satisfying about writing a few lines of code and watching them actually do something useful.

## 🧬 A Bit About Me

I’m a PhD student working in neurodevelopment and biomedical imaging. Python isn't part of my formal training, but I picked it up along the way to help make sense of data, automate tasks, and eventually dive into machine learning. What started as a side skill is slowly becoming part of how I think about science.

I use this repo to:
- Keep track of code that *actually* worked  
- Practice writing better, clearer scripts  
- Build toward more reproducible science

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Expect bugs. Expect strange variable names. Expect workarounds that got the job done but might not be elegant.  
I'm learning — and that’s the point.
