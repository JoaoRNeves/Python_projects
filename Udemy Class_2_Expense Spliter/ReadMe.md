# ðŸ’¸ Expense Splitter with Proportional Custom Split

A Python Tkinter GUI application that helps users split a total expense among multiple people either evenly or by specifying custom proportional percentages. The app dynamically adjusts percentages to always total 100%, preventing errors in manual input.

---

## Features

- Input total expense amount  
- Input number of people sharing the expense  
- Choose between:  
  - Even split (equal shares)  
  - Custom split (specify percentages for each person)  
- Real-time adjustment of percentage inputs to ensure they sum to 100%  
- Validation of user input to prevent invalid entries  
- Displays the amount each person should pay based on the split type

## Known Issues / Limitations

* Number of people must be at least 1 for even split and at least 2 for custom split.
* Percentages are rounded to two decimal places, which may cause tiny rounding differences.

---

## Future Improvements

* Save and load split configurations
* Support for currency selection
* Export results to a file (CSV, PDF)
* More robust input error handling
